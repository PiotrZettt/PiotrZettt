- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Piotr @PiotrZettt.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m passionate about coding, especially python, React and web based aplications. I have created the StartApp House Limited where a group of friends and I work on developing SaaS applications.
- Here, on my profile you can find projects I completed as part of the learning process but also my own, work related applications: "PaulsPanelsLimited" "inspect-it" and "Job Wallet" which are tools used for tracebility and data analysis in a manufacturing environment.
